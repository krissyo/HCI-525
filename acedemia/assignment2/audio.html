    <aside>
      This is my ISC 325 assignment 2. I am enjoying experimenting with html5. This page is devoted to the new audio function.
      Audio is used to insert and play sound files. In the past this would need to be done through embedding a flash script into the page and the sound
      would have to be stored in the flash script. This is much cleaner. Controls are needed for play, pause and volume.
