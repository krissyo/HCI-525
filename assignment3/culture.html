      <h2>Culture</h2>
      <p id="aus-culture">
        Australian culture is very unique and since coming to the U.S.A I have realised this even more. The following list explains my observations.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Australian's value good quality coffee, whereas [most] American's seem to be happy with a $0.99 coffee from Dunkin Donuts which I find very strange.
          </li>
          <li>
            Australian's seem to holiday more. Most American's who I have met so far have not done as much travel the average Australian.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wages, and the cost of living in America is much lower than in Australia, which is good and bad. It is good for tourists even when the exchange rate is low.
            However it is not good for American's travelling, especially to places like Australia.
          </li>
          <li>
            Language. Although both nations speak English, there is a big difference between both speech and written. For instance in Australia we spell certain words with "s" instead of "z" for instance, "realise" vs "realize".
          </li>
        </ul>
